# Self-Driving Car Simulation with JavaScript
This program simulates a self-moving object that learns how to avoid incoming obsticles. <br>
The object (car) uses a multi-layer nerual network, where the network is feed the sensors x, y intersection postion if an object is detected. <br>
There are two buttons that allow the user to save and discard the best performing 'brain'. <br>
Saving the best performing 'brain' means that the next time the page is refreashed, all generations of the object will now have the same 'best brain'. <br>
This program also utilzes genetic operations such as muatation so that model performs better. <br>
The links below cite the orignal source code as well as the tutorial which helped me build this simulation.
